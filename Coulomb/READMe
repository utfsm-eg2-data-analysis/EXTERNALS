OUT/clasd2.out



1.  INP/clasd2.inp  - this file is the "master" input file that basically just points to the other required inputs.

2. RUNPLAN/clas_kin.inp - this file contains the kinematics at which to calculate the cross section and RC. Note that it's pretty sensitive to formatting.

3. TARG/targ.D2tuna - this file contains a lot of info about the target (Z,A, geometry, model to use, etc.). Right now, the only variables that matter are Z and A since the program only calculates the internal corrections.  The model choice is also hardwired for now to use F1F209 from Peter Bosted.

4. OUT/clasd2_details.out  - this gives more detailed output than the summary table above.

To run, you just use the little script (run_extern) in the top level directory.
The usage is:

 "./run_extern <input-file>", leave the ".inp" off the master input file. 

./run_extern clasd2
