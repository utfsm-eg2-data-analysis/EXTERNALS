CCC  from it.  This routine needs the parameter files f1parms.dat    CCC
CCC  and fLparms.dat.  Units are ub/Sr/Gev.                          CCC
CCC *** This is modified to give fit to deuteron for sigt
CCC *** Modified to be for sigt only (former sf=1)
CCC *** Modified to take out lowq2 business.
CCC *** params 1-12 are now hard-wired and used for n/p ratio
ccc *** instead
ccc added code to pre-calculate w-dependent parameters
